I have a wife who has not skied and a 4 and 5 year old who had never seen real snow. We had never skied in Australia before. We wanted to book ski classes for my wife and children and buy lift tickets for all.

The group classes were booked out on the day we could go and the only available class was a private class at 9.30 am. The private classes do not come with lift tickets so we bought day passes.

We left Canberra in high hope at the crack of dawn and stopped in Cooma to hire gear. In the confusion I left my ski boots at the hire shop and I arrived in Selwyn without boots. No problem, I thought, I would hire boots at Selwyn.

On the road still at about 8.30 am we realised we were going to be late, and so we called Selwyn to see whether we could re-schedule the class. The answer was no, there were no other classes available, and we had lost our money. When I went to hire the new boots, the answer was no, they would not fit them to my skis for reasons of company “policy” and I had to hire a complete new set. When I asked whether we could hire a toboggan while waiting they said yes, but we would need special toboggan lift passes and could not use the skiing day passes we had.

When they subsequently discovered there were group classes available at 1 pm, the told us we had to pay again without any credit for the cancelled class and that we needed new lift passes. After an argument we gained a small credit for the lift passes we had.

The ski classes were run between the two buildings and neither child got out on to the snow proper because of the “mix of skills of the children” until I went to take the 5 year old from his class and have a proper ski.

In summary, the snow and the sun were magnificent but the Selwyn Snowfields resort does not own the snow and the sun. At every turn we found a policy that made the experience un-family friendly.

Sure, in the mess of organising skis, gloves, goggles, helmets, stocks, and fitting them to the excited body parts of a 4 and 5 year old, I, somehow left my boots in Cooma, and sure, after naively accepting the class start time of 9.30 am we were late. But we are a family, a fairly normal family wanting to do fairly normal things at a resort that advertises itself as family friendly.

Well, it is not that family friendly when you get into the detail but has a series of unnecessary policies that will view you as a walking wallet, nothing more. The snow is great, but prepare yourself mentally for everything else.",no,en,"Not very family friendly

The facilities are old and in urgent need of renovation to bring them up to todays standard.

They tried to charge admission to the Toboggan slope so that I could take some photo's of my kids, even though I had no intent ion of getting on a toboggan.

The price of food is unbelievable, so take your own, and the attitude of the staff in the Cafe is pretty ordinary. While my kids were making up their mind of what they wanted from the very limited selection the girl behind the counter responded "" That's alright I'm here until  4"". When she told my kids that there would be a wait on their ""Cheeseburgers""  they responded ""That's OK we're here all day""

For a minimal investment it wouldn't be hard to put a couple of benches around the Toboggan slope

Giving paper pass with a plastic zip tie is not enough in this world. Old ski jackets used to have clear plastic pocket around left sleeve for the pass. But I haven't seen those ski jackets for years. They never warned me not to lose it. They only emphasized to hang the pass out on the jacket somewhere. I complained to the manager. No help.

They claim so-called small business like themselves cannot afford chipped plastic card like the rest of the world. Well, it all depends.

We went July 14th and the chair lift queues were less than 2 minutes.
You can hire your gear there, but get there super early to do that because that takes a really long time, and book it online which saves a little time.
You can park right next to the slopes, about a 100 metre walk.
They have benches and tables at the top of the run which is handy for picnics, and a shop selling nuggets and chips and burgers etc. About $10 for burger and chips from memory.

If you are a solid green run skier and/or ready to start skiing blue runs then you will love Selwyn. However, if you like a real challenge or long runs then it's best to stay away as you will just be frustrated.
Also, the facilities are quite basic and run down...lift your game Selwyn and invest some money in the place. Try and add a couple more long runs while you are at it and replace the Racecourse T-bar with a reliable chair lift or add a lift from the bottom of Racecourse to the top of Powerline.

In their website there is no option to opt only for ski training without lift pass. They charge $100 for a lift pass, but the same can be bought for $50 with GroupON coupon. So we wanted to buy only ski training from there website. We called them dozen times to enquire about training pass, snow fall etc. But no one picks up the call.
If you have an option to rent ski costumes, somewhere where you are staying, then it is always better to get them there, instead of standing in long queues in selwyn. Yes, very very long queues ( nearly an hour) even if you want to rent a single helmet as well. If they are ready to accomodate hundreds of people in their resort, they should also think of having multiple customer service points, multiple costumes rental services. It is totally waste of time to wait in so much long queues first for paying, and then for checking your size costumes, exchange rooms, etc. Trust me, you will feel frustrated by their services, if you go on weekends peak seasons.
Second thing is no mobile network, no internet, no wifi. They should have atleast provided wifi just like in Perisher. It is really difficult to communicate with family members without mobile in a strange place.
Third thing, the most horrible toilets. Kids were crying and refusing to go inside the toilets, because of very bad and pathetic smell. Worst part is, there is only one toilet place in the entire Selwyn. They charge us so much for entry fees ($40 per day), trainings, lift, tubbogan etc. Why can't they maintain clean toilets.
Fourth and last thing is, there is no good restaurant or food court which provides food for whole day. There is only one food canteen, which close there meals section once all the burgers( they already preapred for a day) are over. We went to have meals at 12.30 on Sunday, but there was nothing available except french fries. Its always good to carry your own food.

We went there last year (2018).
We was attracted by their website claiming it is a family friendly ski resort. After going to Perisher for 3 years we decided to try somewhere different. So we went to Selwyn Snow Resort for 4 days.
One afternoon, when using the chair life, my son (7 years old and can ski freely on green trails) sat too fast when the chair came, he fall down under the chair, was dragged at least 5 meters! Luckily I was with him at the time however I was on the chair already and couldn't jump off to rescue. The life operator didn't stop the lift immediately, instead he ran up and tried to drag my son out from under the chair! I cried out and ask him to stop the lift immediate. My son was so scared and didn't stop crying. The back of his ski jacket had a long cut by the sharp metal under the chair and his back was injured too, with broken skin and a few drops of blood. If the guy stopped the lift immediately (he stood less than a meter from the control button) all the injury can be avoid. How much loss they will suffer from stopping the lift once?!
Because of the pain and scare, my son couldn't walk fast. The operator became very impatient and kept yelling us to move out quickly and don't block other people's way. Didn't even ask or offer a checkup. A rescue snow motorbike passed and stopped to ask if everything was ok, however the rider refused to take my son up to the Centre despite he did drive up to that direction. My son was too scary to take the chair lift again, so we had to walk up the hill by ourselves holding ski boards on hands! On deep snow! My son's shoes were all wet when we walked up the hill.
The the second day, we went to the information desk and made a formal complaint. The lady was nice but didn't show much interest in investigating. Wrote down our contact detail but we heard nothing from them ever since.
We won't even go back again, and I am spreading the words among my friends and business network to avoid this place, just don't want other people to suffer if same thing happens to them.",no,en,"Avoid this place. No good.

We had one of our ski poles stolen (probably picked up by accident), and the ski hire onsite went above and beyond to resolve our problem, even though we did not hire from them.
All the staff we friendly and it was obvious that this is a family run snow field. We did have a small issue, however the ski team handled this very well.
We did have an issue with another skier and again the staff (ski patrol) were there to sort it out so everyone could get on with a great experience.
If you are keen to learn to ski, this is the place to go. Most people have low ski skills so perfect. Wide runs and no queues! And I mean no (or extremely short) queues - even during the school holidays whilst we were there.
Don’t travel all the way there for the food, however you park your car so close that you can drop by the car to collect your own food. On the other hand, make sure you also support them. Overall is 1/3 the price of the big resorts.

The drive in was a little scary at it was heavily snowing but if you went at a reasonable speed it was perfectly fine. A great adventure and first time experience for my son at the snow!

Good food options inside with some great coffee, very busy but fun.

Gear hire was fairly easy and parking was good. Make sure you have a ticket displayed or you will get a fine.

550,,"Annabelle Wright","4 reviews","2023-07-02 07:14:14",5,25,"This review is for everyone who has been trying to find up to date info about the newly opened facilities. Here is the info you need:
The resort is easy to get to, the parking is huge and well organised. There are a lot of disabled spots about 20m from the front door, and the rest of the car parks are between 30m and 100m from the door roughly. Near enough to grab something you left behind.
The facilities are mostly L shaped. The first area you enter has all the ski and clothing hire. The lines weren't great, weren't the worst, but if you can, do yourself a favour and hire your gear in Cooma before you arrive. Cheaper and no queue. Note you don't get toboggans from this hire area.
The further side of the L has good toilets which never had a queue during our visit, and had warm water for washing hands. Nice! Also gender neutral and accessible toilets.
There is food and drink for sale, it's very much a canteen style place, imagine the set and offerings up at most large places like a theme park. Check out my photos for a record of the menu and prices. The food isn't great, it's pre made burgers, chips, pies, hot dogs etc. I think sandwiches are the most healthy option. Pretty expensive but also super convenient for a warm bite to eat. Eg burger was $15, hot dog $10.
There's also a bar/ cafe with a coffee machine and a good range of milks.
I wish they had water refill stations but I didn't see any, I did figure out you need to ask the bar/ cafe staff for a bottle of tap water (glass cafe style) if you need more water. The canteen staff won't give you a top up.
There are lots of benches to eat at both inside and out though many many people left their stuff on the tables unattended all day, you might need to make room to eat.
There is one bank of lockers for hire, $10 or $15 per day depending on the size. See photo.
I can't speak to the ski/ snowboarding or lifts, but the tobogganing was great. It's situated past the main facilities building, over to the left looking outwards. You use your card (which you get when you enter) to scan into the area where you can collect a toboggan. They have a long travelator from the bottom of the hill up to the top so you don't have to climb it! So good. The ride down is fun too, though definately less bumpy in the morning.
There's loads of spaces around the slopes you can explore to build a snowman etc.
Final note, I saw there was mentions online of a taboggan fast run, and possibly also an ice skating rink etc. These things aren't there, or certainly weren't there in early July 2023.
Overall, amazing time, very fun, great for kids!
Fingers crossed they will update their website with all this info soon!

But I can't help but feel as though management missed an opportunity to really WOW everyone on the long awaited return. You don't often get another chance to make a first impression, and I sadly have to report that the experience overall was poor.

We liked:
- ticket machines for the national park pass, although the touch screen was laggy
- attempts to modernise, such as self service ski pass machines
- nice new buildings, and on-site accommodation
- friendly staff

What we didn't like:
- the process to rent ski's was horrendous. Incredibly, horribly slow. There was no sense of urgency, no hustle. We've all driven 5 hours to be there. On one occasion, we waited 30 minutes just to swap a helmet, and we were second in line. It seemed like they didn't have any work benches, so everything had to be done by staff whilst seated on the ground
- expensive food. 8 bucks for a large soy cappuccino. Granted, they now use proper soy milk
- not enough seating. Hundreds of people forced to sit on the ground inside. Those who got a table selfishly left their stuff on it to stop others from using the space. This may be because there weren't enough lockers, but it's more about people lacking courtesy
- slippery tiles in the bathrooms. In the last facility, there were rubber mats laid down
- most of the snow runs were shut down, even though there was plenty of snow. Only the main front runs were operating and they were wearing out
- the T bar lift in the middle kept breaking down, which put huge pressure on the only other run which was to the top. Lines blew out
- getting passes for the second day was a nightmare. It wasn't clear whether our passes from day one were valid for all days, whether we needed to top them up, or whether new passes needed to be printed. There were no staff there to help, 1 out of 3 machines were down, and the line grew and grew. Finally they started working and we got newly printed lift passes.
- at one point I jumped into the line for the shop and gave up after 10 minutes when the line didn't move and there were 10 people still in front of me

Selwyn is a beautiful place and it is great for beginners. If you purchase during the sale period, it's definitely cheaper than all other places around, and its closer to Sydney and Canberra. If they can get their stuff to really hustle I think that would make the most significant difference to the experience",no,en,"The building is nice and I like the attempt to modernise.

2 weeks ago we had lessons booked in and due to the lack of snow leading up to we tried to contact them in several ways, email, social media, website, phone.

Their phone line just guided us to their website, they read our Instagram messages and still didn’t reply.

After driving 3.5 hours with 2 young kids we turned up and saw several other fustrated families who also didn’t receive any communication.

We then spoke to 3 staff/management who were defensive and hopeless with communication! I do not understand how they can simply not pick up the phone and call the people who are booked in for a lesson to let them know it’s been cancelled. After paying for accommodation and a long drive with 2 young kids we still did not receive any communication what’s so ever about it being closed or our cancelled lessons.

All they offered was a refund, no compensation for cancelled lessons with no communication.

We went back last weekend and it was a mess people everywhere didn’t know what to do, people sitting on the floor as there wasn’t enough seating or lockers.

Food was very expensive, tasteless and greasy, staff were also hopeless in that department it was like they didn’t know what to do.

The snow itself was good for our kids they had fun making snow balls and skiing down the slopes, by the lunch time the slopes became very bumpy and rough rather than smooth.

Overall not a great experience and looking to go to Thredbo or Perisher next time.",no,en,"Poor terrible communication from staff, management was defensive and unhelpful!

New facilities with good food, affordable price. We really enjoy our time playing with snow and skiing here.
However, someone who drive from Selwyn to Canberra should be careful with the shortest road on Google Map to Canberra. The road is underconstruction so the surface was so terrible. Try to search another way to come back to Canberra by getting to Monaro Highway. We nearly got stuck in Boboyan Road, and really heard to get out of this terrible road in dark night. We felt so scared that we might stay whole night in dark and cold. So I truly recommend people who want to go to Selwyn, please come there by Monaro Highway although this road will a bit longer than Boboyan Road.

** My review wouldn't have been so blunt if management listened to their customers. Even the reply below from Selwyn is heartless and empty. Sorry, but not sorry enough to fix the wrong they have done. They are happy to take money from. people and keep it. If they were genuinely apologetic, a credit or refund would be offered to those who booked online in advance but didn't receive what was offered in the descriptions and images. They did not change the toboggan description. Even today it still says ""150 metre snow carpet for effortless laps of fun"" . That's a lie. You had to walk back up the new hill. Again, if free or discounted I wouldn't have complained and accepted the declining snow and effort made by Selwyn. But every person paid full price for a below par product. And most we complaining amungst ourselves. I could hear the poor staff copping the verbal abuse. Just wrong on all levels. I hope you are listening Blyton Group or else no one will be back next year. **

On the day you arrive check if the snow cover has deteriorated to either patches of dirt, mud, slush. Check how many Ski lifts are running. Check the Toboggan slope isn't full on dangerous holes. If you have pre-booked tickets online before you arrive, beware.The management team treat you with no respect. Simply stating their terms and conditions show “no refund”. Selwyn this is wrong. A manager is there to manage situations. Not to just read policy and walk away. Selwyn is great for beginners when it has snowed, but it is managed extremely bad when there is not enough snow. Selwyn, you should offer a refund or credit when the product you are offering doesn’t match what you have sold.

Everyone, hold off booking lift tickets & toboggan tickets until you arrive on the day and see if there is enough snow to actually ski or toboggan. And to see how many lifts are actually running. There is no rush to purchase lift passes or toboggan tickets. These do not sell out. So there is no benefit to pre-booking online before you arrive.

The toboggan slope was unsafe and not usable with large holes all the way down but management disagreed. When it was moved to another area which had snow cover, is was shorter and the slope was too flat to slide all the way to the end. Also, no magic carpet to take you up the hill. I have no complaints if that was free. But management still thought it was fair to charge full price of $25 to use this area. Honestly, it is was no different to taking candy from a baby. Shame on you Selwyn. Won’t be back. Next year off to Perisher for free tobogganing on a hill you can slide down without using your hands or becoming injured sliding into large holes.

If you would like Selwyn's management to change, please write a review. No one can control the weather. So i do feel for Selwyn, that it hasn't snowed. But this is not an excuse to take advantage of you and me. They only might consider to do better for next year if they hear from everyone who felt ripped off and taken advantage of.

We paid a little over $1000 for lift tickets for our family of 4 in March, but spent most of the day walking up the mountain ourselves to ride down the only half decent slope there was. The only lift open was for a short little slope that took about 30 seconds from top to bottom.
I know it’s not the resorts fault that there was no snow and I asked if I could get a credit for next season. The lady was perfectly polite in saying that all she could offer was to have our dates for our lift passes moved to the following week. This, of course is completely impractical as accomodation has been paid for, gear hire has already been paid for, time off work has to be arranged and kids go back to school.
My advice to anyone planning a ski trip here is  to never buy lift passes till they know what conditions are like.

Don’t blame the weather, cause I saw the snow makers stopped before 10 am. Why do I noticed that? Cause I prayed all this morning that even one more line can be opened.

What’s more? When we finally made the decision to leave at noon, buses were coming in. How could they all fit in that little tiny slope?

This year the slopes were very patchy and yet the snow machines were not being used in the evenings we were there. Only one lift was operational but other slopes looked good enough to ski down so I – along with many others – climbed the mountain, skied down and then climbed again (something we could have done without paying hundreds of dollars for lift tickets). In response to the terrible weather, the resort offered $25 lift tickets, drawing more people to the single over-crowded lift. The resort offers no refunds for not utilising their snow machines or for keeping their lifts closed. This is in stark contrast with other weather-dependant holiday activities I have experienced where the company offers a free or discounted re-booking. The lack of customer care demonstrates to me that this resort cares more about getting paying customers than giving a positive customer experience.

I took a lesson to improve my snowboarding and Luke M. from Selwyn did a really great job teaching what I am supposed to learn. After the lesson, I felt like my skill was amped to intermediate level with just short amount of time.
Luke is such a cool, knowledgeable, and approachable instructor. He answered all my questions and he even challenged me to do a jump (my first jump) which I successfully executed (didn’t fall!).

I would give 5 stars for Luke M.!

For the resort, I was impressed how convenient everything were. The parking is huge and centre building just easy with all stuff there (rentals, lesson, and cafe). The staff were very friendly and appreciated their response all my newbie questions (like where are the toboggan area, where to snow play, where the lessons meet up etc.)

My kiddo loved the toboggan area. She likes to ride the magic carpet going up to the top for the toboggan. The resort also provide the toboggan so it is not necessary to hire. Note that there is a fee to use it but we think its worth it.

The prices of the food and beverages are reasonable. Its definitely not a like a ‘theme park’ prices like the others.

I just hope that this resort would get a lot of snow soon. We would definitely come back.

The slope of the resort is very beginner friendly and the vibe of other skiers/snowboarders were all good. Its not so intimidating as the other resorts.

My biggest complaint is the communication. The booking website has all sorts of issues. There is only an email enquiry to contact, but it takes weeks to get a response. There used to be a contact number but it's now removed from the website. Dialing the number is just a recorded message without anyone picking it up. I got overcharged with my booking and it still hasn't been resolved after more than a month.

Here are some useful information:

- If you're traveling from/to Canberra, make sure to use B23 the Monaro Highway.

- Similarly, make sure you turn to Link Rd from Snowy Mountains Highway. Google maps may direct you through another trail but that's definitely not for winter.

- The road to the resort is quite good. When we went there it wasn't snowing so snow chain was not necessary. Listen to the local radio for road status.

- There are plenty of parking spaces. It's important to pay for parking, or rather, the national park pass. There are ticket machines on the way to the ski building. You need the license plate number and can buy multiple days of parking at once. We did see ranger checking cars and giving out fines.

- Ski lift ticket can be bought at the front of the building. Or if you booked online, scan the QR code and the ticket will be printed out. You probably don't need to book it prior to arriving but it does make it easier.

- On the other hand, lessons is better to be booking prior to coming as there are limited spots.

- Equipment can be rented once you arrive. It's a slow process as every other reviewer says, so be prepared. The equipment are quite new as the resort only reopened recently.

- There are lockers for rent. $15 for big ones and $10 for small ones daily.

- You can bring your own toboggan and there is a small area where the kids can use it.",no,en,"Selwyn Snow Resort is quite good for beginners. We enjoyed the lessons and the skiing.

Treatment of staff was ridiculous. We spent well over an hour just figure out where to go etc, as zero signals. Then finally we just walk on and new staff advised we need to purchase several lift tickets to walk in basically. So we complied. Later, the experienced staff tell us that not the case and to get refund for unused tickets.

Have been waiting for weeks now and no refund or response from management. It's not hard to process a refund, nor is it hard to ensure that your staff are trained before you put them in the field.

I love this ski resort because it suitable to bring kids. New facilities are more comfortable and suit us. A lot of parking lots available, new cafe, new toilet, short distance from parking to the ski entrance. I love magic carpet that is useful for toboggan play. So convenient. Pay $25 to play toboggan and u get 1 toboggan to use here.  No outside toboggan allowed

I hope Selwyn Snow Resort could provide more table at outside. I could see there are a lot more space outside. It’s good to have more table. It’s really convenient

I love this ski resort because it suitable to bring kids. New facilities are more comfortable and suit us. A lot of parking lots available, new cafe, new toilet, short distance from parking to the ski entrance. I love magic carpet that is useful for toboggan play. So convenient. Pay $25 to play toboggan and u get 1 toboggan to use here.  No outside toboggan allowed

I hope Selwyn Snow Resort could provide more table at outside. I could see there are a lot more space outside. It’s good to have more table.

616,,"Ashleigh Kaye","5 reviews","2023-11-17 06:10:16",2,2,"There wasn’t a lot of snow fall when we were there in July which is fine, but the machines also weren’t on to help so the whole field was sludge. You couldn’t ride the toboggans as it was so hard and chewed up you couldn’t keep momentum. Paid for the lifts for my son and I and they wouldn’t allow me to ride if I didn’t gear up, which meant my 9yo wouldn’t go on the lifts by himself as he’d never used them before, which was a waste. I contacted customer services and they agreed to refund me my lift pass, which I was grateful for. Months later and back and forth emails they reneged on that and questioned everything I’d relayed in email form after the face to face.

You couldn’t ride the toboggans as it was so hard and chewed up you couldn’t keep momentum. Paid for the lifts for my son and I and they wouldn’t allow me to ride if I didn’t gear up, which meant my 9yo wouldn’t go on the lifts by himself as he’d never used them before, which was a waste. I contacted customer services and they agreed to refund me my lift pass, which I was grateful for. Months later and back and forth emails they reneged on that and questioned everything I’d relayed in email form after the face to face.

Good way to introduce kids to the snow. If you want to keep it simple and cheap you can bring your own food and play with the snow without having to pay for anything. Something that can't be said with other resorts. There are plenty of tables to sit on indoor and out.
You also have an official toboggan and snow tube area. Need to pay $15/$10 per person but the area let's you play all day if you have the energy and toboggans are included in the price.
Snow tubing is $35 per 10 turns but is not limited to one person.
Lifts, ski hire and lessons can be individually purchased or bundled. Prices vary according to the combo you choose.
To get in you need to purchase a national park entrance fee and hire snow chains (even if you don't use them). At the time we went the park entrance was $29 which you pay at the resort as a parking fee. Snow chain hire was $26 which you can pretty much get at any place in Cooma.
Depending how busy it is you need to only park 10 to 200 metres from MAIN building and ski hire right at the entrance.
Food is average pricey fried takeaway food so if you want anything else it is recommended to bring your own. They seem to only accept credit/debit cards
The place seems to be newly renovated and amenities are clean and modern.
On our latest  visit it rain most of the day. 3 lifts were open and only 2 runs open.

One hour queue for gear, then 90% of the runs were closed despite excellent snowfall. They had more runs groomed but wouldn't operate the associated lifts. We only skied for three hours before the main chair lift broke down, forcing everyone onto the only remaining lift (T-bar) only to have that close too. Without a lift to use, and with most of the place inaccessible, we had to go home early. The resort closes at 4.30 but they had all the lifts shut down at 3.30.

If Selwyn wants customers, it needs to do better. You can't book hundreds of skiers then funnel them into only one ski run and one lift. 90% of the runs are closed. We tried to support their return to operation but it seems all the money has gone into the building and the lifts are broken. It's pretty sad.

There was plenty of parking (paid) and despite large crowds, it was well managed. There was a short 20 min wait for us to be fitted for the prebooked rentals, they opened 2 more counters to cater to the increased crowds.

Were served by a lovely Irish girl who was quick and very helpful.  Great place for newbies and plenty of room indoors.
The bistro had small but good selection of food - the usual fries, burgers, soup and curry. The grinders coffee shop served good hot chocolate and coffee and service was quick and smooth. You can also hire lockers at $10 to store your belongings.

Most of the lifts for beginners were working and there was a good amount of snow and the fields were well groomed. We had lessons with ski instructors from Europe - big thanks to Flo, Paul for the adults lessons which wad great and for kids too. All in all, a lovely experience (we also got some snow and rain too, which added to the fun). Look forward to being here again next year.

We have visited Selwyn many times in the past and enjoyed the small resort. Unfortunately their behaviour when it comes to refunds is abhorrent. We bought ticket mania tickets in 2023 when they were open for about 2 weeks that season. We requested refund at the time and they refused but did give credit for 2024. Due to personal circumstances we cannot use it in 2024 (and would not have bought it for 2024) and they are still refusing refund. Consumer law protects us from businesses like Selwyn claiming no refunds when they can’t provide advertised services.

EDIT I have backtracked my emails and Selwyn Facebook posts to paint a picture of how many days the lifts could have been running:
Jun 23 - Open
July 9 - Closed
July 10 - Open
July 30 - Closed
Aug 19 - Open
Aug 20 - Closed

My guess is it was closed for more days (all updates have been deleted off their website) but max opening is about 30 days and realistically only a few days skiable without risk of damaging gear on rocks. Take into account that they advertised 30 June to 1 Oct as the dates the pass could be used. I’ve also added a photo of what an ‘open day’ this season looks like.

Meanwhile metres away there was actual snow they could have practiced on.

Very disappointed at how the resort closure has been handled. There is a major lack of understanding that your customers often have to take annual leave, organise dog sitters, book accommodation and drive over 8 hours to the resort. All these customers that are making an effort to support the resort after the fire will not be returning.

At 6.30pm on the night prior to our lift pass booking, we received an email that the lifts would not be spinning. A credit for the 2023 season was offered, but the lifts have not even spun since.

If you cannot provide a service that customers have paid for, you should be providing refunds in full. An extension to 2024 is not good enough as that is not the service that was purchased.",no,en,"***

If you do decide to go to Selwyn i highly recommend you DONT pre purchase lift passes. Buy them on the day when you arrive.

If they have no snow, too much snow, power outages, mechanical issues with the lifts etc you wont get to ski and you wont have any recourse.

On our 3rd ski day, we arrived at Selwyn to find that they had had an awesome snow dump overnight. Should be a great ski day right! Wrong, no runs were open and no chairs were running.

Selwyn closed all the ticket machines so no one could buy a lift pass.

We spent half the day onsite and by lunchtime no runs were open so we left to head home to Cooma. I fully expected i'd be able to get a refund for our 3rd day or at the very least a credit toward another trip, especially seeing as Selwyn closed the ticket machines for that day, they knew that people would be upset if they purchased a ticket and couldn't ski.

When we arrived home I contacted them numerous times and was told we will not be issued a refund or a credit for our last day. Family of 5 so this was a very costly trip for us.

700,,"Amit Kumar Madaan","Local Guide · 203 reviews","2025-07-02 09:20:47",5,0,"Selwyn Snow Resort, nestled in the northern Snowy Mountains of New South Wales, offers a welcoming and affordable alpine experience, particularly suited for families, beginners, and those returning to snow sports. ￼

⸻

🏔️ Terrain & Facilities

Spanning 45 hectares, Selwyn provides a variety of gentle slopes ideal for novice and intermediate skiers. The resort features 8 lifts, including two chairlifts, two T-bars, a platter, a poma, and two magic carpets, ensuring accessible terrain for all skill levels. Notably, 88% of the terrain caters to beginners and intermediates, with the “Racecourse Run” offering a challenge for advanced skiers.  ￼ ￼

After the devastating 2019–2020 bushfires, Selwyn underwent a complete rebuild, reopening in June 2023. The revamped facilities include modern equipment hire, clean dining areas, and efficient lift operations, enhancing the overall guest experience.  ￼ ￼

⸻

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family-Friendly Atmosphere

Selwyn is renowned for its family-oriented environment. The resort’s layout allows parents to easily supervise children, and the tobogganing and tubing areas are particularly popular among younger visitors. The manageable size of the resort ensures a relaxed and enjoyable experience without the overwhelming crowds found at larger resorts.  ￼

⸻

💰 Affordability & Accessibility

Selwyn stands out as one of Australia’s most budget-friendly ski resorts. Adult day passes are priced at AUD 119, with youth and child passes at AUD 95 and AUD 35, respectively.  The resort’s proximity to Sydney (approximately a 5-hour drive) and Canberra (about 2.5 hours) makes it an accessible option for day trips or short getaways. ￼ ￼

While there is no on-mountain accommodation, nearby towns such as Adaminaby, Talbingo, and Cooma offer various lodging options to suit different budgets.  ￼

⸻

❄️ Snow Reliability & Conditions

Selwyn’s lower altitude can lead to variable snow conditions, especially early and late in the season. However, the resort has invested in extensive snowmaking capabilities, covering 35 hectares, to ensure consistent snow coverage. August typically offers the best natural snow conditions, with an average base depth of 26 inches.  ￼ ￼

⸻

🧳 Visitor Tips
•	Bring Your Own Food: Dining options are limited, and meals can be expensive. Packing your own food is advisable.  ￼
•	Arrive Early: To secure parking and avoid crowds, especially during peak times, it’s best to arrive early.()
•	Check Snow Reports: Stay updated on snow conditions and lift operations via the resort’s official website before planning your trip.  ￼

⸻

⭐ Overall Impression

Selwyn Snow Resort offers a charming and cost-effective alpine experience, particularly appealing to families and beginners. Its recent renovations have enhanced the facilities, providing a comfortable and enjoyable environment. While it may not satisfy advanced skiers seeking challenging terrain, Selwyn’s relaxed atmosphere and affordability make it a worthwhile destination for those new to snow sports or looking for a family-friendly getaway. ￼ ￼ ￼

🏔️ Terrain & Facilities

Spanning 45 hectares, Selwyn provides a variety of gentle slopes ideal for novice and intermediate skiers. The resort features 8 lifts, including two chairlifts, two T-bars, a platter, a poma, and two magic carpets, ensuring accessible terrain for all skill levels. Notably, 88% of the terrain caters to beginners and intermediates, with the “Racecourse Run” offering a challenge for advanced skiers.  ￼ ￼

After the devastating 2019–2020 bushfires, Selwyn underwent a complete rebuild, reopening in June 2023. The revamped facilities include modern equipment hire, clean dining areas, and efficient lift operations, enhancing the overall guest experience.  ￼ ￼

⸻

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family-Friendly Atmosphere

Selwyn is renowned for its family-oriented environment. The resort’s layout allows parents to easily supervise children, and the tobogganing and tubing areas are particularly popular among younger visitors. The manageable size of the resort ensures a relaxed and enjoyable experience without the overwhelming crowds found at larger resorts.  ￼

⸻

💰 Affordability & Accessibility

Selwyn stands out as one of Australia’s most budget-friendly ski resorts. Adult day passes are priced at AUD 119, with youth and child passes at AUD 95 and AUD 35, respectively.  The resort’s proximity to Sydney (approximately a 5-hour drive) and Canberra (about 2.5 hours) makes it an accessible option for day trips or short getaways. ￼ ￼

While there is no on-mountain accommodation, nearby towns such as Adaminaby, Talbingo, and Cooma offer various lodging options to suit different budgets.  ￼

⸻

❄️ Snow Reliability & Conditions

Selwyn’s lower altitude can lead to variable snow conditions, especially early and late in the season. However, the resort has invested in extensive snowmaking capabilities, covering 35 hectares, to ensure consistent snow coverage. August typically offers the best natural snow conditions, with an average base depth of 26 inches.  ￼ ￼

⸻

🧳 Visitor Tips
•	Bring Your Own Food: Dining options are limited, and meals can be expensive. Packing your own food is advisable.  ￼
•	Arrive Early: To secure parking and avoid crowds, especially during peak times, it’s best to arrive early.()
•	Check Snow Reports: Stay updated on snow conditions and lift operations via the resort’s official website before planning your trip.  ￼

We were amazed to see the difference in weather from muggy in Sydney to a downpour of rain in Jindabyne. The drive to Selwyn has you doubting that snow even exists here in NSW. It's not until you are 1 hr out from the resort that the snow and ice appear. Absolutely breath taking views. The resort is nice. I wish the machines were working out of the 6, There only was 1 which worked. Which an employee had to stand there and hand feed cards through. Also, maybe cover the kiosk machines. I was retieving 10 cards yesterday and found it hard as the place where the kiosks are placed is right bang in the middle of an air tunnel, and it's freezing. There is no cash on premises it is strictly cashless. Staff and instructors were incredibly helpful/ patient and kind. We will definitely be back again.

Im a frequent visitor since 4 years ago to your ski resort.
Our family of 5, (3adults and 2kids) has been both skiing and tobogganning.
However I've experienced the worst customer service today by your manager.
Our kids were skiing however they also wanted to do the tobogganning even we thought the snow condition looked terrible by just looking at the tobogganning area. But we trusted selwyn and we were sure they won't open the area if it was so bad. So my husband bought tickets for the tobogganning for 2 adults and 2kids which cost us $140. But when we actually went up to toboggan down, we saw everyone pushing down with their hands and some were just walking down as there were so many grass patches and ice bumps everywhere.
We definitely thought it will be so hard to toboggan down and it was right we had to walk down as it was absolutely impossible to toboggan down.
So I went straight to the office to get the refund as for the family of four paying $140 we totally wasted our money.
The manager told me due to their ""terms and conditions"" they couldn't provide us with the refund at all.
When I was walking out both the managers and the worker were talking on my back.
I decided we will never re visit selwyn in future as this just turned us away from a nice little ski resort.
Today I just felt selwyn weren't family friendly anymore.
I just told my friends who were planning to book for ski trips next week to selwyn to cancel and rather go to corin forest.

Dear Selwyn Ski Resort Management,

I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the experience my family and I had at your resort during our visit on the weekend of July 13, 2025. Arriving at 8.30am Unfortunately, the quality of service we encountered was far below expectations, especially considering the high cost of our visit.

1. Staffing and Operations:
Given the online booking system in place, it would seem that you would have had an accurate indication of the number of visitors for that weekend. However, it was clear upon arrival that your resort was significantly understaffed.

Your rental desk had five counters, yet only two or three were staffed, with minimal assistance provided to the large crowd. We had to wait for over 5.5 hours just to pick up our rental gear.

By the time we were finally on the slopes, it was 2:45 pm, leaving us with just 1 hour of skiing before the resort closed at 4pm. As we had paid for full-day lift tickets for 2 adults and 2 children, this experience was incredibly disappointing.

2. Lift Ticket Machines:
Out of four available machines, only one was functioning, causing lengthy delays and further frustration for all visitors trying to purchase tickets. This level of disorganization is unacceptable for a resort of your size.

3. Food and Beverage Service:
At the cafe, there were only two baristas managing both coffee orders and counter service. The wait times were excessive, with a 45-minute wait for a coffee and hot chocolate, which is simply unacceptable.

4. Facility Cleanliness:
The resort's toilets and other facilities were noticeably unclean, and I did not observe any efforts to maintain or sanitize them throughout the day. This is particularly concerning in a high-traffic environment like a ski resort.

5. Cashless Payment and Connectivity Issues:
While I understand the move to a cashless resort, the lack of proper internet reception is a major issue. Many visitors, including ourselves, were unable to complete transactions or access your website due to poor mobile network coverage, leading to further inconvenience.

In light of these numerous issues, we have clearly been misled by your advertising and charged for services that were not provided as promised. As a result, I will be lodging a formal complaint with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) for misleading advertising and inadequate service delivery.

Given the severe lack of service and the frustration we encountered, I kindly request a full refund for the lift tickets and rental fees pre paid for close to 4 weeks before our attendance.

I hope you will take the time to address these concerns and take immediate steps to improve the guest experience for future visitors. I look forward to your prompt response.

Sincerely,
Ripped off client

It was very upsetting when you plan your day and get there early, pre paid your ski lesson for the morning so you knew how to ski for the rest of the day but unfortunately due to the slow moving line everything was out of our control.

We joined the ski gear rental queue at 9:15am and only got served at around 12:30pm.
A 3hr+ wait to rent pre-booked gear is unacceptable.

We also watched one couple who had already waited 2hrs get turned away because they didn't have any ski's left to fit the gentleman. Note that this was in a pre-booked line where Selwyn would've received their sizing details in advance. They were only able to receive credit (not a refund), which they would have to apply for online. I would not accept this if I were them.

Management were absolutely atrocious. When people started complaining a couple of hours into the wait, management claimed that they had no idea that these issues were occuring. Absolute joke.

Unfortunately, we lost a lot of our ski time due to poor management. We will never rent ski gear from here again, and urge others to avoid doing so too.

Shout out to the employee with a curly mullet, wearing a martial arts t-shirt, who manned the  rental desks. You could visibly tell that he was working at an incredible pace, and was absolutely committed to helping speed up the queue.

We expected it to be busy, unfortunately the management didn't seem to plan for that.

After getting in the queue to collect the rental gear we thought it would maybe take 30 minutes. Much to our surprise there was no movement at all in the queue in that time.

There seemed to be just two guys working on the pre-booked ski gear section, and they worked at snails pace.

The hours went by and we were still far from being served. Several hours later some other staff showed up, and they actually showed some urgency.

I reached the service counter at 1.11pm after first joining the queue at 9:27am.

Much to my surprise I was taken care of quickly when I was served. I don't know what was going on earlier.

There was a couple that reached the counter, got served but then some equipment wasn't available. The guy serving them actually disappeared for 15 or so minutes and just left the customers standing there with looks of bewilderment on their faces.

Eventually that couple left without the gear that they had expected would be available.

People were talking about leaving the queue and driving to local ski rental places, but those thoughts went out the window when they heard the carpark was at capacity and you would be left without a park if you tried that.

Overall it was the worst experience at a ski resort. Surely the booking system could have shown a bumper crowd was expected.

It seems pre-paid bookings is money in the bank and service delivery was the last of their concerns.

On top of that men's toilets didn't seem to have a cleaner visit at all during the day and they ended up a disgusting mess. I was tolk the women's toilet ran out of toilet paper and was also a mess.

Rubbish didn't seem to be removed for public areas where people were eating.

And now for the snow. When finally getting out there it wasn't so bad, but the short chairlift that ends near the main building had a poorly designed run off area. So many skiers were being knocked over by the chair before they could safely clear that space.

Do yourself a favour. Choose another ski resort and you will have a lot better time!

CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NON-EXISTENT. THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT RAISING REVENUE.

We arrived at the resort just after 9am. Instead of skiing, we spent 4 hours standing in a queue to get our pre-purchased rentals. Only 2 staff were serving us with very low speed as if they couldn't see the people waiting. There was no supervisor to assist them. There is clearly a lack of staff training and support from management.

At one stage a woman with a ponytail wearing a black jacket who appeared to be from management came out to address a complaint. I was hoping she could say something to the crowd to at least acknowledge the long wait, but she just left as if she didn't know we were all waiting there for a long time.

A big shout to the young staff member with a curly mullet. He seemed to be the only one who was aware of the people waiting, working at an incredible pace. You could visibly tell he cared and was trying his best to address this situation.

While we were standing there for hours in the queue, we saw those paying on the spot for rentals got their equipment quickly. Of course we could just wait, as they already have our money in their pocket! All they care is their reveue! Not their guests!

I also read some reviews about their no refund policy and that there is no refund even when chairlifts were closed and they kept selling tickets and lessons when there was not enough snow. Selwyn had their excuse in their responses which seemed to be they can’t control the weather. All ski resorts face changing weather conditions. Good resorts monitor weather conditions actively and make responsible decisions accordingly. Unfortunately Selwyn does not, because they care about getting more money into their pocket too much!

THE RESORT IS DISORGANISED AND UNPROFESSIONAL

Even though it is a newly built resort, there is a lack of clear signs. When we arrived we saw a queue at the entrance. I had to ask a staff member to confirm this was for scanning the QR code to get our tickets. There was no sign telling us this. There were at least three of these machines. However, only one was working, hence the long queue. There are also no signs to tell you the name of ski trails or chairlifts, or their difficulty levels. I would think having clear signs to at least indicate the difficulty level is an important safety measure at a ski resort!

Chairlift staff were unprofessional. When the gate to the chairlift wouldn’t scan properly and open, the staff member looked in our direction for a few seconds she cleared heard the sound from the machine indicating something was wrong, but she just turned her head and ignored us as if she didn’t see there was a problem. We were left to solve the problem ourselves.

The getting off area of the beginner lift was so badly laid out that many people fell. There was not enough a slope to ski away quickly from the lift, so you could get caught by the turning chairlift and get knocked over. Although once I knew the issue I could try to ski faster and make a turn to avoid getting caught, it would be very difficult for a beginner skier for whom this trail is designed for. We saw so many people falling there.

Also despite being newly built, there is not even a dedicated area for rental returns. At the end of the day, we were told to  just dump our equipment on the floor. It was a complete mess with half of the entire retal area taken by ski enquipment. There was nowhere even to sit to take my ski boots off.

There was no toilet paper in the women’s toilet in middle of the day. I checked at least 3 cells, there was no toilet paper! The toilets were dirty and they didn't seem to have enough cleaners available.

All the above is a huge contrast to our experience at Thredbo. We definitely will NOT visit Selwyn again!",no,en,"Disappointment was all we had at Selwyn. So many issue there.

Consumers are entitled to a refund for a service that is not delivered in a reasonable time frame.

Like other reviewers on Saturday 12 July, I prebooked hire skis so that I could get kitted out early and hit the slopes and get a good six hours of skiing in. I would accept 30 minutes waiting for service. I could even accept an hour if management were proactive, and let us know the true situation and appeared to care about their customers, but three hours in and less than halfway to the service desk, and a rather lost site manager who did not seem empowered to do anything but tell people to send an email that would take 10 days for a response. Interestingly, there is pretty quick turnaround on responding to poor Google reviews, maybe the resources are misdirected.

A four hour wait to collect hire skis that can only be used for the remaining 2 hours the lifts are operating would certainly be “not in a timely manner”, and cancellation of the hire altogether would most definitely fall into that category, and both obligate Selwyn Snowfields to provide a REFUND. I would encourage anyone that is unable to obtain a refund (not a credit, a refund) to look into  taking the matter to the NSW small claims court, while also claiming compensation for other lost costs such as accommodation,  park entry fees, fuel and wasted time.

And running out of helmets and skis for prepaid bookings reminds me of a Seinfeld episode:

Jerry: “I don't think you do. You see, you know how to *take* the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation.

735,,"S M","Local Guide · 42 reviews","2025-07-14 02:48:50",1,2,"I am incredibly disappointed with my experience at your resort over this past weekend (July 12th). My partner and I had arrived at your resort nice and early at 8:15am. We promptly started queuing in the online pick up rental line for our pre-booked Skis Boots and Poles rental. We then had to wait close to FOUR HOURS, arriving at the front of the line close to 12pm. This was shocking enough as is, but what followed was even more shocking.

I told the staff member my skis and boots sizes, and after a long search for my boot size, I was provided with a boot that was larger than the size I requested. I was told that this was ALL THEY HAD left in stock. I tried them on, and they clearly were too big but I was willing to try and make it work just so me and my partner could get out skiing with what was left of the day. However, the complete disorganization continued when I asked for my skis.

I’m 190cm tall, and usually use 170cm skis. The staff member then told me that he couldn’t find any in 170cm, so I swallowed my frustration and just asked to get whatever he could get me. He then said all he could offer me was a pair of 150CM SKIS?? The only offers were skis 20 cm too small and boots one size too large, which are unsafe, unprofessional, and negligent, increasing risk of injury! He then disappeared for over 30 minutes trying to find skis somewhere else in the resort, but came back with nothing. I applaud the staff members for their efforts and honestly feel really bad for them and the stress they were under; and all my qualms are with the horrendous management of this whole operation.

But wait, that’s not all. After being told that there was absolutely nothing for me…no boots that fit me, no skis above 150cm to use with my boots, we left completely frustrated at 1PM and in disbelief without our pre-booked rentals. We were kindly told by other frustrated customers in the queue that we could head down to Adaminaby to rent some equipment there. So we drove the 50 minutes to adaminaby, picked up skis, boots, poles from the Ampol Ski Hire, which took a total of less than 10 MINUTES for me and my partner, and drove back to Selwyn thinking we could squeeze in at least an hour of skiing before the resort shut. I didn’t think it was possible for us to be even more disappointed than we were. But after our return, we were denied entry to Selwyn due to the resort being ""overfilled,"" despite having valid lift passes. We were told to “come back early tomorrow.” We had no choice but to drive off to our accommodation and call it a night.

When we spoke with a group of skiers on Sunday who had been a few groups behind us in the queue on Saturday, they advised they had no issues getting fitted with the same ski and boot sizes that we were told were unavailable. It is baffling and deeply frustrating that we were denied these sizes and turned away, yet guests behind us received them without trouble. This points to inconsistent service standards and extremely poor customer service.

The next day (Sunday), we came straight in with our Ampol Ski Hire skis and had a day of skiing. However, the Sunday skiing was overshadowed by the frustration of the previous day’s ordeal. Our plan was to spend the whole weekend skiing, and we had driven in from Sydney on Friday night, and left Kozzi back to Sydney on Sunday night to celebrate a birthday weekend. If we had known it was going to only be one day of skiing, we would not have driven a collective FOURTEEN HOURS FOR ONE DAY OF SKIING. 14 hours including the drive to Adaminaby and back, and I haven’t even added in the FOUR hours of wasted time waiting in line for NOTHING.

I understand things can get busy during school holidays, but to OVER accept the amount of bookings for entries, as well as rentals in spite of knowing full well how much stock/availability you have, feels like a blatant robbery.

This was an unbelievably negative experience; I have never written a negative review or felt the need to ever do one, but this truly was something else.",no,en,"I am incredibly disappointed with my experience at your resort over this past weekend (July 12th).

This was an unbelievably negative experience; I have never written a negative review or felt the need to ever do one, but this truly was something else.",en,"Local Guide · 42 reviews",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102831318763035948501?hl=en,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21sbE1tWXpNRE53VFVGeGQwOWxOVTFCYkRWeE5XYxAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x7f5b0a4be5eade4!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOmllMmYzMDNwTUFxd09lNU1BbDVxNWc%7C0cS6-H-W8DU%7C?hl=en,

Our only gripe about the whole day was the food hall not being monitored for table hoggers. Setting themselves up for the whole day, with bags of food, packets of ramen etc... Obviously not buying food from the kiosk. So we stood there with $80 worth hot food and balanced it whilst eating.

Thoroughly enjoyed it. Bruce was an excellent teacher.
Resort is nice, didn't wait to get any lunch either. Only me & my husband in the line.
We rented equipment back in Wagga and was the best decision....(do not rent gear from the resort if you don't want to wait).

Few points though;
Only 1 chairlift was open, which made the beginner slopes very busy for beginners and a little scary when experienced people came down the slope really fast. Just a bit too much traffic.

The tables inside were booked up with people's belongings and food boxes, they should be made to hire a locker or eat at their car if they insist on bringing stuff and booking tables. We bought lunch and ended up sitting at someone else's stuff...until they came back.

The ticket machines at entrance, make it a lot easier if they all worked....plus the lady at the front was a bit rude and not very helpful. (Put a smile on ya dile and give Selwyn Snow Resort a happy welcoming face).

Also, say tht all lessons need a helmet to be worn. Common sense i know, but I didn't have one and had to go & hire one before I started my lesson.
It only said children were to wear helmets (unless I missed the bold print about adults too).

Anyway we will be back, but only during the week....due to how busy it gets (which would be every snow resort). Still give you a 4 star because our experience was great and I get places get a bit overwhelming at times...",no,en,"Went up on 10th July. Booked in for a skiing lesson.

Several safety concerns stood out—most notably, the presence of exposed metal fencing around the beginner tracks. Unfortunately, I injured my knee on one of these, which left me feeling that the environment was not as safe as it should be, especially for beginners.

Food options were limited and surprisingly expensive. What made this more frustrating was the lack of visible pricing—there were no price tags, so I only discovered the cost at the register, which felt a bit misleading.
The bathrooms were also disgusting and looked like they had never been cleaned. There was only one soap dispenser and they had replaced the soap with water!

I also found the general attitude of the staff disappointing. During my lesson, the instructor took an unnecessarily harsh tone with participants, singling out individuals for making mistakes and drawing attention to them in a way that felt humiliating rather than constructive. That said, I want to acknowledge that Sienna and Paige were both incredibly kind and helpful, and their friendliness was a real bright spot during the visit.

There was absolutely no proper system, no crowd control, and no clear communication from the staff. Despite having a booking, we never received our rentals – just stood in line for hours with nothing to show for it.

The resort was clearly overwhelmed and unprepared for the number of visitors. Staff seemed lost, and no one took responsibility or provided solutions. What should have been a great day out turned into a frustrating, exhausting, and completely wasted experience.

This is unacceptable, and we absolutely deserve a refund for both the poor service and lost time. I strongly do not recommend Selwyn Snow Resort to anyone based on this experience. They need to seriously improve their operations and customer service.

They need to seriously improve their operations and customer service.",en,"5 reviews",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114605916663474448836?hl=en,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pSMVVFWkNNbEpoYW1VdFpVazNXbko2ZWxKT1prRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x7f5b0a4be5eade4!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOjR1UEZCMlJhamUtZUk3WnJ6elJOZkE%7C0cT7DRM4Kok%7C?hl=en,"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90CEQVv7R-Bdcj-6HyhVjTKBwhP96Qd6u5e7x00fGSKv-EqrPq-xZMe05Zyz8ohsCYkSryCtmQkz19giXMJaoCPKDO49vaQ-_Xqh-vjeUTIV-stDjrNC3sEfhQIFmBZwtVuCQVdZONx0ThKz,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90CN2yaEXtQcrk4oTqux251y2Ui-xiDV3aFFICEfJkCcV94ZeCUy8-nvW7PRvMmVERyokFGqdAS9tOINrXD_lDV_L78ctXHux4C2Hc1vy9JjHAtR6zMhOL6ivwW70ycZEdzCPLKtQ6HcXiY,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90B8SPmiYO0pIGILZ5Ne4EKSwWZhrq2HY5nVHPkqrgnX3YBdjpMyj7HqX_y0MerwPGeIhDdKqf1XCVDBlPHuR1PmCUPCIzi9dtRNpuPg1RGr-sHPolXWeA-SmAThtbvNc7VuXTYNmLDCkvug"

We had an amazing time at Selwyn Ski Resort! It’s a fantastic spot for families — our kids had an absolute blast. The staff were incredibly friendly, and the ski lessons were well run. Big shoutout to Paige, who was wonderful with the kids! Paige looks after us last Sunday for a group of 10 kids.

Ski hire was much cheaper than at Thredbo or Perisher, which was a great bonus. While food prices were a bit higher, it’s understandable given the seasonal nature of the resort.

The resort closes at 4:30 PM, which actually worked out well for relaxing evenings. The drive up was stunning — snow-covered and very scenic. We also found more affordable accommodation options nearby in places like Tumut.

Overall, this was our best snow trip yet — we’ll definitely be back super soon!

Pls list a phone number to contact you, would be very handy for people planning it for the first time, few things on the website is confusing, not very clear. Thank you

It's true that it's less standard than its counterparts, but it still does the job.
The downside is that the surrounding area is deserted and unsuitable for housing. It's best to come from Canberra for a full day and return in Morocco.

We were met with a long line at the front of the building to collect lift and toboggan tickets from one machine as all of the others were not working. The staff also had to keep replacing the cards which added more time onto collecting tickets. They then redirected us to the shop to collect tickets, but it still took time. The toilets were not maintained properly, as it was unclean. The burgers from the bistro weren't good, they only had a small patty, lettuce and tomato all in a soggy bun. There was no mention of the dirty food trays which we could only use. The coffee took a long time as there was only 1 barista making the drinks which lead to long wait times. As well as that, no one was enforcing the tables inside only for people purchasing from the bistro (shown on the signs at the table) because there were many people having BYO food there which made finding a seat really hard despite the reserved seating. Finally, the tobogganing conveyor kept stopping and starting which made us have to either walk on the conveyor or walk up the park. We noticed many people going in the tobogganing park unticketed, as there was no permanent fencing and people were sharing their cards. Overall our visit was not worth the $35 fee per person which could be simply avoided as mentioned before.",no,en,"My family went to Selwyn on July 19 to enjoy some snow and toboggan with some friends.

1) For the love of god, don't hire your gear from here, especially in peak visit periods. Selwyn are significantly understaffed and you will be waiting hours in the line to get fitted. Best to hire where your accommodation is and take your stuff up to the mountain. Some people line up at 8:30am and aren't on the mountain till after 2pm!

2) Bring your own food and drink! Its outrageously expensive and has huge wait times for food and hot beverages. Almost $60 for 2 x (nuggets and chips meal deal).

3) Check the snowcams and make sure there is plenty of snow before you book online (can still book online the morning you are planning to ski). They have a no-refunds policy, even if lifts are shut/on wind hold, you won't get your money back.

If you follow the above advice, it is much cheaper than Perisher/Thredbo and you can have a fun time on the mountain.",no,en,"Fun little resort, but an honest FYI for anyone wanting to visit.

We did not attend in school holidays or during a particularly busy period and despite that we waited in line 1hr and 45 mins to collect our pre booked rental equipment.

The facilities are disgusting and noticeably filthy even upon arrival at 8:30am. There were no visible attempts to maintain these throughout the day either.

There is a lack of signage with no clear indication where to go and who can help you. Surprisingly, the snow shop also acts as a service desk, with one attendee who was clearly (and understandably) overwhelmed.

Previous attendees have described the lack of resources during the peak period to which the resort responds saying they had staffed according to anticipated volume during holiday period and in reality it exceeded their expectations. However, we witnessed the same issues outside of this busy period. The problem with this resort is not their inability to cope with volume but simply poor management and organization, period.

All instructors were late for their 9am lessons as supposedly they were held up on the access road which was evidently clear from snow and traffic, it appears their staff is as disorganized as their management.
We were told the instructor would wait while our son waited in line for his rental only to discover they’d proceeded without him.
Ana the Manager was extremely unhelpful nor was she empathetic. Thankfully though, she did eventually manage to move our sons lesson 2 hours after his booked session when finally collected his equipment. We were then met with an instructor who was late and full of attitude and discontent who then proceeded to finish the lesson early because she was hungry and angry (self described).

We witnessed multiple episodes of beginner skiers and boarders falling from the lift without assistance or attention to lift movements whilst the lift attendees threw snowballs at their passing instructor friends,
Or in some instances, the lift was completely unattended.

The food choices are minimal and poor not to mention overpriced. The resort also fail to advertise pricing. The one food attendant lacked customer service skills and general hygiene etiquette and coughed the entire time she sat at the register.

We also witnessed tourists on foot venturing up and down the slopes in the designated ski area without reprimand which is extremely hazardous to themselves and skiers/boarders  alike.

The positives, the young man who eventually served us at the rental counter was very apologetic and kind.
The tobogganing area is great with the functional magic carpet and bolsters at the end. This place has amazing potential to be the perfect spot for families, small resort vibe, the gentle slopes for the kids and affordable group lessons is also very attractive.

Highly recommend getting your rentals elsewhere, take a packed lunch and pre load your passes prior to arrival. We will be back to give it another shot with the above in mind.

I  hoped bad reviews on this were just one bad weekend, it isn’t. This place wouldn’t care about your time, ski hire queue is the slowest queue on earth - we waited for over 3hrs on a not so long queue to get the skis, and it was already midday by the time we got them. And we missed our lessons and when we tried to communicate that, they showed us others who were also in same boat and the guy at counter was like I can’t do anything about it. He offered to book a lesson for $50 😆- which I can do myself too.

You’d think you are better off if you BYO skis or hire elsewhere- you are happily joining another queue to use the chair lift. If you are hungry, you are joining another queue, coffee? There’s another queue. They should change the name to Queues Snow Resort 😁

This place is greedy and will issue as many tickets passes as possible with no attention to capacity in terms of staff or facilities. Staff seem helpless, well under capacity snd unhappy.

The cafe area was almost always full all day, so  you can’t really find a place to sit. Toilets were ok.

Food and drink is a bit expensive, so try to bring your own.

2.5hr drive from Wagga. No snow chains required in 4WD.
Beautiful scenic drive, even saw wild brumbies.
Grab fuel in Tumut as no petrol stations at the resort.

All the staff were really happy and helpfull, food and drinks was delicious from the cafe and bistro, toilets and seating area was really clean and tidy.  We had a private lesson booked for 9.30am with Max who was a really good teacher really helped us to get the most out of the day.

All the staff were really happy and helpfull, food and drinks was delicious from the cafe and bistro, toilets and seating area was really clean and tidy.  We had a private lesson booked for 9.30am with Max who was a really good teacher really helped us to get the most out of the day.

I was very happy to have chosen Selwyn!! I was at Thredbo one month ago so easy to compare. Selwyn is so chilled compared to the craziness of Thredbo. There are more runs over there but you really pay for it! The cost of the lift tickets and lessons were so much better and affordable at Selwyn. I particular wanted to mention Stefan and Jimmy who taught my daughter. She learned so much more than at her snow boarding lesson at Thredbo. They they really encouraged her and before the day was out, she was all over the mountain!
I also want to acknowledge those on the lifts. They were so friendly and fun!
Thanks so much our entire group had a really wonderful trip and we will definitely be back!
